Data Analyst focusing on transforming messy data into impactful insights through clean visualizations, intuitive dashboards and storytelling. Proficient in Power BI, SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python(Data Analysis), with hands-on experience in data cleaning, transformation, and data modelling. 

Projects featured here highlight a blend of analytical thinking and practical application in exploratory data analysis and business intelligence. On a mission to turn raw data into insights that speak for themselves — one tool at a time.

This GitHub portfolio showcases some of my key projects, where I've applied real-world datasets to solve problems, uncover trends, and support data-driven decisions. I'm continuously learning and exploring areas like Machine learning, Natural Language Processing and other Data vizualization tools with a strong interest in making data clear, actionable, and impactful.

## Projects
1. <a href="https://github.com/BhavatharaniSankar/twitter_sentiment_analysis">**Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Hate Speech Detection on Twitter using NLP**

    Built a machine learning model to detect hate speech by performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data. Applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, stop-word removal, lemmatization, and TF-IDF vectorization for text preprocessing. Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing sentiment trends and word frequencies to uncover key insights.

2. <a href="https://github.com/BhavatharaniSankar/Furniture_sales_dashboard">**Furniture and Office Supplies Sales Dashboard**
   
    Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze furniture and office supply sales across multiple countries (2017–2020). Used Power Query for data cleaning and transformation, built data model relationships, and created DAX measures to track key KPIs like revenue, profit margin, YOY growth, and category-wise performance.

3. <a href="https://github.com/BhavatharaniSankar/Mall_Customer_Segmentation">**Mall Customer Segmentation using Clustering algorithm**</a>

    Conducted a Customer Segmentation for a mall dataset using Unsupervised machine learning technique to identify the distinct customer groups based on spending behavior and demographics. Applied clustering algorithm such as K-Means to segment customers using features like annual income and spending score. The project helped to uncover the key customer patterns to support targeted marketing strategies and improve the customer engagement at the mall.
